### 👨‍💻 About Me

Aspiring Data Scientist  

🔭 I completed a data science bootcamp with HyperionDev, where I gained hands-on experience in machine learning, data analysis, and natural language processing.

🌱 I use Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and SpaCy to explore and model data, solve real-world problems, and build NLP applications.

📚 To deepen my knowledge, I’ve also earned industry-recognized certifications, including the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate and the Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate.
